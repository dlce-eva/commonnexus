class Format(Payload):
    """
    The FORMAT command specifies the format of the data MATRIX. This is a crucial command because
    misinterpretation of the format of the data matrix could lead to anything from incorrect results
    to spectacular crashes. The DATATYPE subcommand must appear first in the command.

    The RESPECTCASE subcommand must appear before the MISSING, GAP, SYMBOLS, and MATCHCHAR
    subcommands.

    The following are possible formatting subcommands.

    1. DATATYPE = {STANDARD | DNA | RNA | NUCLEOTIDE | PROTEIN | CONTINUOUS}.
       This subcommand specifies the class of data. If present, it must be the first subcommand
       in the FORMAT command. Standard data consist of any general sort of discrete character data,
       and this class is typically used for morphological data, restriction site data, and so on.
       DNA, RNA, NUCLEOTIDE, and PROTEIN designate molecular sequence data. Meristic morphometric
       data and other information with continuous values can be housed in matrices of
       DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS. These DATATYPES are described in detail, with examples, at the end of
       the description of the CHARACTERS block.

       .. warning::

        ``DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS`` is currently not supported in `commonnexus`.
        Some programs accept (or expect) datatypes beyond the ones defined in the NEXUS spec;
        e.g. MrBayes has ``DATATYPE=RESTRICTION`` and Beauti may create "NEXUS" files with
        ``DATATYPE=BINARY``. `commonnexus` does not accept these non-standard datatypes and raises
        an exception when trying to read the MATRIX. Thus, to make "NEXUS" files with
        non-standard datatypes readable for `commonnexus`, substituting ``DATATYPE=STANDARD`` is
        typically the right thing to do.

    2. RESPECTCASE. By default, information in a MATRIX may be entered in uppercase, lowercase, or
       a mixture of uppercase and lowercase. If RESPECTCASE is requested, case is considered
       significant in SYMBOLS, MISSING, GAP, and MATCHCHAR subcommands and in subsequent references
       to states. For example, if RESPECTCASE is invoked, then SYMBOLS="A a B b" designates four
       states whose symbols are A, a, B, and b, which can then each be used in the MATRIX command
       and elsewhere. If RESPECTCASE is not invoked, then A and a are considered homonymous state
       symbols. This subcommand must appear before the SYMBOLS subcommand. This subcommand is not
       applicable to DATATYPE = DNA, RNA, NUCLEOTIDE, PROTEIN, and CONTINUOUS.
    3. MISSING. This subcommand declares the symbol that designates missing data.
       The default is "?". For example, MISSING=X defines an X to represent missing
       data. Whitespace is illegal as a missing data symbol, as are the :data:`INVALID_SYMBOLS`
    4. GAP. This subcommand declares the symbol that designates a data gap (e.g., base absent in
       DNA sequence because of deletion or an inapplicable character in morphological data). There
       is no default gap symbol; a gap symbol must be defined by the GAP subcommand before any gaps
       can be entered into the matrix. For example, GAP=- defines a hyphen to represent a gap.
       Whitespace is illegal as a gap symbol, as are the :data:`INVALID_SYMBOLS`
    5. SYMBOLS. This subcommand specifies the symbols and their order for character states used in
       the file (including in the MATRIX command). For example, SYMBOLS="0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7" designates
       numbers 0 through 7 as acceptable symbols in a matrix. The SYMBOLS subcommand is not allowed
       for DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS. The default symbols list differs from one DATATYPE to another, as
       described under state symbol in the Appendix. Whitespace is not needed between elements:
       SYMBOLS="012" is equivalent to SYMBOLS="0 1 2". For STANDARD DATATYPES, a SYMBOLS subcommand
       will replace the default symbols list of "0 1". For DNA, RNA, NUCLEOTIDE, and PROTEIN
       DATATYPES, a SYMBOLS subcommand will not replace the default symbols list but will add
       character-state symbols to the SYMBOLS list. The NEXUS standard does not define the position
       of these additional symbols within the SYMBOLS list. (These additional symbols will be
       inserted at the beginning of the SYMBOLS list in PAUP and at the end in MacClade. MacClade
       will accept additional symbols for PROTEIN but not DNA, RNA, and NUCLEOTIDE matrices.)

       .. warning::

            While the specification requires the content of the SYMBOLS subcommand to be enclosed in
            doublequotes, `commonnexus` also allows unquoted content; i.e. `SYMBOLS=01` is treated
            as equivalent to `SYMBOLS="01"`.

    6. EQUATE. This subcommand allows one to define symbols to represent one matrix entry. For
       example, EQUATE="E=(012)" means that each occurrence of E in the MATRIX command will be
       interpreted as meaning states 0, 1, and 2. The equate symbols cannot be any of the
       :data:`INVALID_SYMBOLS` or any or the currently defined MISSING, GAP, MATCHCHAR, or state
       SYMBOLS. Case is significant in equate symbols. That is, MISSING=? EQUATE="E=(012)e=?" means
       that E will be interpreted as 0, 1, and 2 and e will be interpreted as missing data.
    7. MATCHCHAR. This subcommand defines a matching character symbol. If this subcommand is
       included, then a matching character symbol in the MATRIX indicates that the states are
       equivalent to the states possessed by the first taxon listed in the matrix for that
       character. In the following matrix, the sequence for taxon 2 is GACTTTC:

       .. code-block::

            BEGIN DATA;
                DIMENSIONS NCHAR = 7;
                FORMAT DATATYPE=DNA MATCHCHAR=.;
                MATRIX
                    taxon_l GACCTTA
                    taxon_2 ...T..C
                    taxon_3 ..T.C..;
            END;

       Whitespace is illegal as a matching character symbol, as are the :data:`INVALID_SYMBOLS`

       .. warning::

            `commonnexus` uses `"."` as default MATCHCHAR. So if `"."` is used as a regular state
            symbol, the NEXUS must be read using the `no_default_matchchar` config option.

    8. [NO]LABELS. This subcommand declares whether taxon or character labels are to appear on the
       left side of the matrix. By default, they should appear. If NOLABELS is used, then no labels
       appear, but then all currently defined taxa must be included in the MATRIX in the order in
       which they were originally defined.
    9. TRANSPOSE. This subcommand indicates that the MATRIX is in transposed format, with each row
       of the matrix representing the information from one character and each column representing
       the information from one taxon. The following is an example of a TRANSPOSEd MATRIX:

       .. code-block::

            MATRIX
                character_1 101101
                character_2 011100
                character_3 011110;

    10. INTERLEAVE. This subcommand indicates that the MATRIX is in interleaved format, i.e., it is
        broken up into sections. If the data are not transposed, then each section contains the
        information for some of the characters for all taxa. For example, the first section might
        contain data for characters 1-50 for all taxa, the second section contains data for
        characters 51-100, etc. Taxa in each section must occur in the same order. This format is
        especially useful for molecular sequence data, where the number of characters can be large.
        A small interleaved matrix follows:

        .. code-block::

            MATRIX
                taxon_1 ACCTCGGC
                taxon_2 ACCTCGGC
                taxon_3 ACGTCGCT
                taxon_4 ACGTCGCT
                taxon_1 TTAACGA
                taxon_2 TTAACCA
                taxon_3 CTCACCA
                taxon_4 TTCACCA

        The interleaved sections need not all be of the same length. In an interleaved matrix,
        newline characters are significant: they indicate that the next character information
        encountered applies to a different taxon (for nontransposed matrices).
    11. ITEMS. Each entry in the matrix gives information about a character's condition
        in a taxon. The ITEMS subcommand indicates what items of information are listed
        at each entry of the matrix. With discrete character data, the entry typically consists
        of the states observed in the taxon (either the single state observed or several states
        if the taxon is polymorphic or of uncertain state). This can be specified by the state-
        ment ITEMS=STATES, but because it is the default and the only option allowed by
        most current programs for discrete data, an ITEMS statement is usually unnecessary.
        For continuous data, however, the wealth of alternatives (average, median, variance,
        minimum, maximum, sample size)t often requires an explicit ITEMS statement to in-
        dicate what information is represented in each data matrix entry. Some ITEMS (such
        as VARIANCE) would be appropriate to only some DATATYPES; other ITEMS such as
        SAMPLESIZE and STATES would be appropriate to most or all DATATYPES. If more
        than one item is indicated, parentheses must be used to surround the list of items,
        e.g., ITEMS=(AVERAGE VARIANCE); otherwise the parentheses are unnecessary,
        e.g., ITEMS=AVERAGE. More information about ITEMS options can be found in the
        discussion of the different DATATYPES under MATRIX; information specifically about
        the STATES option is given under STATESFORMAT.

       .. warning::

            Settings other than ``ITEMS=STATES`` are currently not supported in `commonnexus`.

    12. STATESFORMAT. The entry in a matrix usually lists (for discrete data) or may list
        (for continuous data) the states observed in the taxon. The STATESFORMAT subcommand
        specifies what information is conveyed in that list of STATES. In most current programs for
        discrete data, when a taxon is polymorphic the entry of the matrix lists only what distinct
        states were observed, without any indication of the number or frequency of individuals
        sampled with each of the states. Thus, if all individuals sampled within the taxon have
        state A, the matrix entry would be A, whereas if some have state A and others have state B,
        the entry would be (AB), which corresponds to the option STATESFORMAT=STATESPRESENT.
        Because it is the default for discrete data, this statement is typically unnecessary with
        current programs. The other STATESFORMAT options can be illustrated with an example, in
        which two individuals of a taxon were observed to have state A and three were observed to
        have state B. When STATESFORMAT=INDIVIDUALS, the state of each of the individuals (or other
        appropriate sampling subunit) is listed exhaustively, (A A B B B); when STATESFORMAT=COUNT,
        the number of individuals with each observed state is indicated, e.g., (A:2 B:3); when
        STATESFORMAT=FREQUENCY, the frequencies of various observed states are indicated, e.g.,
        (A:0.40 B:0.60). The STATESFORMAT command may also be used for continuous data, for which
        the default is STATESFORMAT=INDIVIDUALS.

        .. warning::

            Only the default setting ``STATESFORMAT=STATESPRESENT`` is currently supported in
            `commonnexus`.

    13. [NO]TOKENS. This subcommand specifies whether data matrix entries are single symbols or
        whether they can be tokens. If TOKENS, then the data values must be full NEXUS tokens,
        separated by whitespace or punctuation as appropriate, as in the following example:

        .. code-block::

            BEGIN CHARACTERS;
                DIMENSIONS NCHAR= 3 ;
                CHARSTATELABELS 1 hair/absent
                    present, 2 color/red blue,
                    3 size/small big;
                FORMAT TOKENS;
                MATRIX
                    taxon_1 absent red big
                    taxon_2 absent blue small
                    taxon_3 present blue small ;
            END;

        TOKENS is the default (and the only allowed option) for DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS; NOTOKENS is
        the default for all other DATATYPES. TOKENS is not allowed for DATATYPES DNA, RNA, and
        NUCLEOTIDE. If TOKENS is invoked, the standard three-letter amino acid abbreviations can be
        used with DATATYPE=PROTEIN and defined state names can be used for DATATYPE=STANDARD.

        .. warning:: ``TOKENS`` is currently not supported in `commonnexus`.

class Matrix(Payload):

    In its standard format, the MATRIX command contains a sequence of taxon names and state
    information for that taxon. The MATRIX itself is of the form

    .. code-block::

        MATRIX
            taxon-name entry entry... entry
            taxon-name entry entry... entry
            taxon-name entry entry... entry;

    Each entry in the matrix is the information about a particular character for a particular taxon.
    For example, it might be the assignment of state 0 to taxon 1 for character 1. Thus, the entry
    would consist of one state symbol, 0. If the taxon were polymorphic, the entry would consist
    of multiple state symbols, e.g. (0 1), indicating the taxon has both states 0 and 1. More
    details about the nature of each entry of the matrix are given under ITEMS and under each
    DATATYPE. Each entry needs to be enclosed in parentheses or braces whenever more than one state
    symbol is given, e.g. (01) with standard data and the default NOTOKENS option, or if the
    information is conveyed by more than one NEXUS token, e.g., (0:100) or (2.3 4.5 6.7). Otherwise,
    the parentheses or braces are optional. No whitespace is needed between entries in the matrix
    unless the TOKENS subcommand of the FORMAT command is invoked or implied and parentheses or
    braces do not surround an entry.
    Taxa need not be in the same order as in the TAXA block, and the matrix need not contain all
    taxa. For interleaved matrices, all sections must have the same taxa in the same order.
    Examples of matrices of different DATATYPES are described below.

    1. For STANDARD data, each entry of the matrix consists of a single state-set. Under the
       defaults (ITEMS=STATES and STATESFORMAT=STATESPRESENT), each entry of the matrix consists of
       a single state-set; if there are multiple states, then the entry must be enclosed in
       parentheses (indicating polymorphism) or braces (indicating uncertainty in state). For
       example, in the following matrix,

       .. code-block::

            BEGIN CHARACTERS;
                DIMENSIONS NCHAR=9;
                FORMAT SYMBOLS="-+x";
                MATRIX
                    taxon_1 (-+){-+}+---+--
                    taxon_2 +x-++--+x
                    taxon_3 -++++--+x;
            END;

       taxon_1 is polymorphic for the first character and has either state - or state + for the
       second character. If STATESFORMAT=COUNT or FREQUENCY, then each entry must be enclosed in
       parentheses because more than one token is required to convey information for even one state:

       .. code-block::

            BEGIN CHARACTERS;
                DIMENSIONS NCHAR=3;
                FORMAT STATESFORMAT=FREQUENCY SYMBOLS = "012";
                MATRIX
                    taxon_1 (0:0.251:0.75) (0:0.31:0.7) (0:0.51:0.32:0.2)
                    taxon_2 (0:0.41:0.6) (0:0.81:0.2) (1:0.152:0.85)
                    taxon_3 (0:0.01:1.0) (0:0.551:0.45) (0:0.11:0.9);
            END;

    2. For DNA, RNA, NUCLEOTIDE, and PROTEIN data, each entry of the matrix consists of one or more
       state symbols describing the state(s) at one site in a molecular sequence. If
       STATESFORMAT=STATESPRESENT and if an entry represents a single state, then it is represented
       as a single state symbol (or if DATATYPE=PROTEIN and TOKENS, as a three-letter amino acid
       name). If an entry represents multiple states, then it must be enclosed in parentheses
       (indicating polymorphism) or braces (indicating uncertainty in state). Following is a matrix
       of DATATYPE=DNA:

       .. code-block::

            BEGIN CHARACTERS;
                DIMENSIONS NCHAR=12;
                FORMAT DATATYPE = DNA;
                MATRIX
                    taxon_1 ACCATGGTACGT
                    taxon_2 TCCATGCTACCC
                    taxon_3 TCCATGGAACCC;
            END;

    3. For CONTINUOUS data, each entry in the matrix must be enclosed by parentheses if more than
       one item is specified in the ITEMS subcommand. Parentheses must also be used whenever
       multiple tokens are needed for an entry in the matrix. If an entry consists of a single
       token (eg., 0.231), it may be written without parentheses but must then be separated from
       other entries by whitespace.

       .. code-block::

            MATRIX
                A 0.453 1.43 78.6
                B 0.34 1.02 55.7
                C 0.22 1.79 69.1;

       A matrix entry can include average, minimum, maximum, variance, standard error, sample size,
       and a listing of states observed in the taxon, as specified in the ITEMS subcommand. The
       sample size, if included, must be in the form of an integer; the other numbers can be either
       in English decimal (e.g., 0.00452) or in exponential form (e.g., 4.52E-3). The information
       listed for each taxon for a continuous character is specified in the ITEMS subcommand of the
       FORMAT command. For example, if the matrix contains only information about the minimum and
       maximum value for each taxon, the ITEMS subcommand would be ITEMS=(MIN MAX) and a small
       matrix might look something like this:

       .. code-block::

            MATRIX
                taxon_1 (0.21 0.45) (0.34 0.36)
                taxon_2 (0.13 0.22) (0.45 0.55);

       If the ITEMS include the raw measurements (states), e.g., to list a sample of measurements
       from individuals, then the other items must precede the listing of states. There is no
       restriction on the number of elements in the listing of states. This example has only one
       continuous character:

       .. code-block::

            FORMAT DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS ITEMS=(AVERAGE STATES) STATESFORMAT=INDIVIDUALS;
            MATRIX
                taxon_1 (1.2 2.1 1.6 0.8 1.8 0.3 0.6)
                taxon_2 (1.6 2.2 1.7 1.0 2.0 1.6 1.9 0.8);

       in which the first value is the sample average and the subsequent values comprise the sample
       of observed states. Possible ITEMS to be included are MIN (minimum), MAX (maximum), AVERAGE
       (sample average), VARIANCE (sample variance), STDERROR (standard error), MEDIAN
       (sample median), SAMPLESIZE, and STATES. The manner of presentations of states can be
       indicated using the STATESFORMAT command. The default ITEMS for continuous data is AVERAGE.

    .. note::

        Since reading the matrix data only makes sense if information from other commands - in
        particular :class:`FORMAT <Format>` - is considered, the ``Matrix`` object does not have
        any attributes for data access. Instead, the matrix data can be read via
        :meth:`Characters.get_matrix`.
